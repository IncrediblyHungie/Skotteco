# Services Page Redesign — Design Doc

## Context
The services page needs to match the detailed brief at `~/Downloads/skotte-services-brief.md`. Current page has incorrect pricing tiers and retainer structure.

## Decisions
- Single Web Rebranding tier ($3,500–$5,000) replaces the 3-tier layout
- 4 monthly retainers as separate cards (GBP+Reviews $600, Social $500, Lead Gen $1,000, Full Stack $2,000)
- Keep add-ons section
- Add Hosting & Ownership section from brief
- Keep existing: What's Included grid, Timeline, Comparison, Guarantee, CTA

## Page Structure (top to bottom)
1. Page header
2. Web Rebranding hero card (single tier, full checklist, "who it's for")
3. What's Included 3-column detail grid (existing)
4. 5-Day Timeline (existing)
5. Monthly Retainers — 4 cards with Full Stack highlighted
6. Add-ons grid (existing)
7. Hosting & Ownership (new section)
8. Comparison table (existing)
9. Guarantee (existing)
10. Bottom CTA (existing)

## JSON-LD
Update structured data to reflect single rebranding tier + 4 retainers.
